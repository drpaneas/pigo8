Get ready to dive into the nostalgic world of Game Boy development, powered by PIGO-8! This template lets you create authentic Game Boy-style games using the beloved PICO-8 workflow, but with the added power of Go and PIGO-8's extended feature set.

## 🌟 Features

- **PICO-8 Style Workflow** (sprites, maps, sound)
- **Extended PIGO-8 Powers** (Go's full capabilities!)
- **Modern Dev Experience** (hot-reload, debugging)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Set up your Game Boy palette**

   ```bash
   # Copy the Game Boy palette.hex to your project
   cp path/to/gameboy/palette.hex .
   ```

2. **Create your assets**

   ```bash
   # Launch the editor in Game Boy mode
   go run . -w=160 -h=144
   ```

   - Design your sprites in the sprite editor
   - Create your map in the map editor
   - Save both `spritesheet.json` and `map.json`

3. **Embed your resources**

   ```bash
   # Make sure your main.go has this line:
   //go:generate go run github.com/drpaneas/pigo8/cmd/embedgen -dir .

   # Generate the embed.go file
   go generate
   ```

4. **Configure Game Boy settings**

   ```go
   settings := p8.NewSettings()
   settings.TargetFPS = 60
   settings.ScreenWidth = 160
   settings.ScreenHeight = 144
   settings.WindowTitle = "Game Boy Style Demo"
   ```

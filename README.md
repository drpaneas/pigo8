![pigo8_logo](pigo8.png)

PIGO8 is a Go library (package) that reimagines the creative spirit of the PICO-8 fantasy console, allowing developers to build charming, retro-style games entirely in Go.
Built on top of [Ebitengine], PIGO8 gives you a pixel-perfect environment with a familiar and fun API inspired by PICO-8, without needing to learn Lua and start your arrays counting from 1.

While PIGO8 is inspired by PICO-8, it does not contain or distribute any part of the original PICO-8 engine or its proprietary assets.
It is a clean-room reimplementation for educational and creative purposes.

## Features

* Go-first API: Design and develop retro games in idiomatic Go code.
* PICO-8 Style: Recreates the look and feel of the PICO-8 API and game loop.
* Sprite & Map Support: Import `.p8` files and reuse your graphics and map data.
* Backed by Ebiten: Harness cross-platform power with minimal setup.
* Nostalgic Aesthetic: Build games that feel right at home on a fantasy console.
* Editor: Extremely basic minimal editor for sprite and map creation.
* Extras: Custom palletes, any resolution and helpful new functions (e.g. for collision detection).
* Sound System: Audio player plays any wav file.
* Advanced Palette: Dynamic color palette management with alpha transparency support.
* Fade System: Frame-by-frame fade transitions for smooth scene changes and effects.
* Enhanced Sprite Editing: Multi-sprite editing capabilities with different grid sizes.

### Basic Game Structure

```go
package main

import p8 "github.com/drpaneas/pigo8"

// Game represents our game state
type Game struct {
    // Your game state variables here
}

// Init initializes the game
func (g *Game) Init() {
    // Initialization code
}

// Update updates the game state
func (g *Game) Update() {
    // Update game logic
}

// Draw draws the game
func (g *Game) Draw() {
    // Drawing code
}
```

```go
func main() {
    // Create an instance of the game
    game := &Game{}
    
    // Insert the game into PIGO8
    p8.InsertGame(game)

    // Run the game with the configured settings
    p8.Play()
}
```

or with custom settings:

```go
func main() {
    // Create an instance of the game
    game := &Game{}
    
    // Insert the game into PIGO8
    p8.InsertGame(game)
    
    // Configure settings
    settings := p8.NewSettings()
    settings.WindowTitle = "My PIGO8 Game"
    settings.ScaleFactor = 4
    settings.TargetFPS = 60
    settings.ScreenWidth = 160
    settings.ScreenHeight = 144
    
    // Run the game with the configured settings
    p8.PlayGameWith(settings)
}
```

**Note**: *If you have any of the `spritesheet.json`, `map.json`, `palette.json` or any `music*.wav` files in the same directory as your game, PIGO8 can automatically load them. To do that, you need to put at the top of your `main.go` the following line:*

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/drpaneas/pigo8/cmd/embedgen -dir .
```

And run `go generate` to generate the embedded files.

## Installation

To add PIGO8 to your Go project:

```bash
go get github.com/drpaneas/pigo8
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, or improving docsâ€”pull requests and issues are encouraged.
If you are interested in contributing to PIGO8, read about our [Contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Using .p8 Files

If you have existing assets made in PICO-8, you can load them by using [parsepico].
This will read your `*.p8` cartridge and extract `spritesheet.json` and `map.json`.
By placing those two JSON files into the same directory with your PIGO8 game, they will automatically get picked up by the library.

**Note**: You must own a legitimate copy of PICO-8 to access its files.
PIGO8 does not redistribute any proprietary data or code from Lexaloffle.

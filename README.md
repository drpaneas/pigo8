PIGO8 is a Go library (package) that reimagines the creative spirit of the PICO-8 fantasy console, allowing developers to build charming, retro-style games entirely in Go.
Built on top of [Ebitengine], PIGO8 gives you a pixel-perfect environment with a familiar and fun API inspired by PICO-8, without needing to learn Lua and start your arrays counting from 1.

While PIGO8 is inspired by PICO-8, it does not contain or distribute any part of the original PICO-8 engine or its proprietary assets.
It is a clean-room reimplementation for educational and creative purposes.

## Features

* Go-first API: Design and develop retro games in idiomatic Go code.
* PICO-8 Style: Recreates the look and feel of the PICO-8 API and game loop.
* Sprite & Map Support: Import .p8 files and reuse your graphics and map data.
* Backed by Ebiten: Harness cross-platform power with minimal setup.
* Nostalgic Aesthetic: Build games that feel right at home on a fantasy console.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```sh
go get github.com/drpaneas/pigo8
```

### Hello World

```go
package main

import p8 "github.com/drpaneas/pigo8"

type myGame struct{}

func (m *myGame) Init() {}

func (m *myGame) Update() {}

func (m *myGame) Draw() {
 p8.Cls(1)
 p8.Print("hello, world!", 40, 60)
}

func main() {
 p8.InsertGame(&myGame{})
 p8.Play()
}
```

## Using assets from .p8 Files

If you have existing assets made in PICO-8, you can load them by using [parsepico].
This will read your `*.p8` cartridge and extract `spritesheet.json` and `map.json`.
By placing those two JSON files into the same directory with your PIGO8 game, they will automatically get picked up by the library.

You need to add this line to your `main.go`:

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/drpaneas/pigo8/cmd/embedgen -dir .
```

and then do:

```sh
go generate
go build
```

This will generate an `embed.go` file that will be used by PIGO8 to load the assets.
So now you can run your game as usual, without having to worry about the assets.

**Note**: You must own a legitimate copy of PICO-8 to access its files.
PIGO8 does not redistribute any proprietary data or code from Lexaloffle.
